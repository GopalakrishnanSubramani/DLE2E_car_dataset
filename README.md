## 📌 Introduction

3D object representations are valuable resources for multi-view object class detection and scene understanding. Fine-grained recognition is a growing subfield of computer vision that has many real-world applications on distinguishing subtle appearances differences. This cars dataset contains great training and testing sets for forming models that can tell cars from one another. Data originated from Stanford University AI Lab.

## 💵 Content
The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split. Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, ex. 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
To build end to end car classification models using PyTorch followed by the Segmentation model for precise classification of the car. The car classification web app technology is operated with the use of different programming languages and software such as Python, Deep-Learning, PyTorch, OpenCV and many more
